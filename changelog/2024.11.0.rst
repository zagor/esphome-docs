ESPHome has grown over time and become more friendly for vendors to create and pre-install ESPHome onto devices
they sell / give away / provide. We are seeing more devices with ESPHome pre-installed, and we are so happy to
see how accessible it is becoming for regular Home Assistant users (not just developers or tech-savvy people) to
get their hands on a device that; A, works out of the box, B, works locally, and C can be fully customized by
the person who bought it if they choose to do so.
Because there are now more devices you can buy and do not have to install ESPHome onto yourself, we have made some
updates to allow ignoring these discovered devices from the ESPHome Dashboard as for most of these devices, you
don't actually need to **take control** and write and manage your own firmware for them.

Further to this, we have slightly changed the identity of ESPHome as an add-on in Home Assistant. It is now called
**ESPHome Device Compiler**, because that is what it does, and most people do not need it if they are not going to
actually compile anything.

OpenTherm
---------

This release brings :doc:`/components/opentherm` support to ESPHome. Please see the
:doc:`documentation </components/opentherm>` for detailed information about it and how to use it.

ESPHome ``armv7`` Docker Support
--------------------------------

We will be retiring ESPHome's Docker support for ``armv7`` hardware in the February 2025 release.

This is due to both waning support as it relates to tooling and performance reasons. We strongly recommend moving to a
more modern architecture, especiallly if you're using the ESPHome Device Compiler to build/compile firmware for your
devices.
